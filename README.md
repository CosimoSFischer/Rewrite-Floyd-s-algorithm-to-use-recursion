# Rewrite-Floyds-algorithm-to-use-recursion
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

# Original code to PEP standards
Given an imperative Code for the Floyds Algorithm (see "Original Python code for an imperative version of Floyd's algorithm"), it was adjusted to PEP standards (see same Code adjusted to PEP standards).
# Floyd's Algorithm using a recursive code
The code is written in a recursive manner (see "Floyd's Algorithm with PEP standards - using recursion"). 
# Unit tests on recursive code
There are three Unit tests written (see "Unit Tests for Recursive Floyd's Algorithm")
# Performance tests - checking the difference between the imperative and recursive code
There are two codes written to test the performance, for the imperative and the recursive code, for each one simple "import timeit" test (see "Performance test on imperative Code on Floyd's Algorithm" and "Performance test on recursive Code for Floyd's Algorithm").
