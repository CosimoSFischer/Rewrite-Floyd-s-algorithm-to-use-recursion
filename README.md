# Rewrite-Floyds-algorithm-to-use-recursion
Given an imperative Code for the Floyds Algorithm (see Original Python code for an imperative version of Floyd's algorithm), first, it was adjusted to PEP standards (see Code).
Secondly, it is written in a recursive manner (see Floyd's Algorithm with PEP standards - using recursion).
